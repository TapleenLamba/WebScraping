# WebScraping


Project Summary:

In this project, I successfully implemented two key technical tasks. Firstly, I utilized Splinter for automated browsing and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing to scrape Mars news article titles and previews from a specific website. This involved creating a BeautifulSoup object, extracting relevant HTML elements, and storing the information in a list. Following the confirmation of a successful list, I closed the browser.

Secondly, the project involved scraping and analyzing data from the Mars Temperature Data Site using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and Pandas DataFrame to organize the data into seven columns. I conducted data type inspections and converted columns to appropriate datetime, int, or float types. With the cleaned data, I generated informative bar charts illustrating the average minimum daily temperature on Mars, the average daily atmospheric pressure at the Curiosity rover's location, and the duration of a Martian year in terrestrial days. To conclude, I saved the DataFrame to a CSV file.

Technologies Used:

Splinter for automated browsing


BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing


Pandas DataFrame for data organization and analysis


CSV for data storage


Overall, the project allowed me to apply fundamental skills in data collection, organization, analysis, and visualization, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of Mars-related data.
